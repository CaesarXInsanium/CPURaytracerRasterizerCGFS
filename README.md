# Computer Graphics From Scratch

This is my attempt at making a software ray tracer using C, SDL and CGLM.
I have made another CPU ray tracer in Rust using an image library but that one was boring and 
did not work as intended.

This repo is an implementation of what is described in the book "Computer Graphics from Scratch"
by Gabriel Gambetta.

After learning a bit of C and learning more about stuff I think that I am ready to make a 
software ray tracer in C.

## Goals

- implement software ray tracer
- learn graphics programming
- learn how to design and implement a program
- apply data structures and algorithms
- learn SDL graphics library
- learn some bitwise operations

## Wish List

- Multithreading?
- Game engine?
